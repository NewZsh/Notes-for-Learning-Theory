Notes of Statistical Machine Learning Theory

*The notes is mainly based on the book **Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms** XXX, 2014?*

## 1. Formulation

### 1.1 Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)

*Corresponding to Chapter 2-5 in UML. This part mainly answers the quesion: What can we know about the generalization error? How does the hypothesis set (in application, the choice of classifier, regressor or so on) reflect our prior knowledge, or, inductive bias?*

**The learner's input**:

- Domain Set
- Label Set
- Training data

**The learner's output**:

**A simple data generation model**:
